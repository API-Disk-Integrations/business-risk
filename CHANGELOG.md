# Business Risk changelog

What changed in the public API — endpoints, request and response schemas,
authentication, error codes, plans, quotas and the base URL. Generated from the
contract itself; edit the contract, never this file.

gets no entry here.

---

Derived from the published API contract, the plan catalog, the free sandbox
allowance and the client SDKs, as each of them changed. Every headline above is
built from the entries beneath it. Dates are the dates the change shipped.
Base-URL entries name only origins the API is actually served on: a loopback or
platform-assigned host is written before the product domain is attached and was
never an address anyone integrated against.
